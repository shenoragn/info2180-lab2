				<h2>The Higher the Monkey Climb.....</h2>

					'Di more di monkey climb, di more im backside expose', is a popular Jamaican prverb that outrightly reveals that people who desire fame or power should be prepared to have 
					every aspect of their lives examined. Take note too that the good, the bad, the ugly and the indifferent will become noticeable by everyone.
						
					The popular notion is that the more an unsuitable person get promoted the more his/her inadequacies shows.I now see that this is a one sided view of the monkey and that view is the monkey's backside, therefore the monkey is now in a better position to (let's behave right here) on you.
					The other view is that the Monkey now has a better view of the world and can now appreciate it more. Anyways... to each his own.

				<h2>The Nail that Sticks Out.</h2>
				<h4>October 4,2021 by Shenor</h4>

					'The nail that sticks up, WILL be hammered down.' If you are a carpenter building a house, this makes a lot of sense. Nails that stick out are dangerous,
					causing injury or damage to various things that can get snagged. We expect a carpenter to pound in that protruding nail. But this saying is referring to people.
					It means that people who stand out, because of their behavior, their looks, their academic performance (not only falling behind, but even being too far ahead) â€“ need to be made to conform.
						
					On the other hand, one cannot simply do less than or mediocre and expect to be noticed. If you truly want to get ahead in life or in the work place doing what you are suppose to is indeed not enough.
					You have to show value, you have to show that you can handle more that you are given in order to be given more to handle.
